# ML_CLASSIFICATION-GENDER-identify
This is a machine learning project built using Python and Keras that predicts an individualâ€™s gender based on physical attributes such as height, weight, shoe size, voice pitch, resting heart rate, and sleep hours. The project includes data preprocessing, normalization, and train/validation/test splits to prepare the dataset for accurate model training. It uses a feedforward neural network for binary classification and achieves ~97% validation accuracy and ~95% test accuracy. The project also features exploratory data analysis with 2D and 3D visualizations to identify patterns and correlations between features and gender. This demonstrates a complete end-to-end ML workflow, from data handling to model evaluation.
